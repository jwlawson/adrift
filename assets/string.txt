First line of this story.
What is this place?
Looks a bit like a spaceship.
Not much to see down here. Strange how dark it is.
How many of these small passages are there?
What are those? Plants maybe?
They seem to be blocking the way.
Well at least they broke apart easily.
Why would someone leave a turret to guard an empty room?
I wonder if the targeting is broken?
These look like bedrooms or studies.
A closet? Or a bedroom for someone nobody likes?
A sentry guarding... erm... nothing?
What happened here?
This might have been a nice place. Once.
Windows. So we must be in space.
But the last thing I remember was being at home. On earth.
What on earth was that?
Wonder whether they break as easily as the other plants.
This is a really long, ominous corridor.
How big is this place?
This view would be really impressive if I wasn't being shot at.
Which came first? The plants or the turrets?
These plants don't look like anything I've seen before.
Will there be any way to find out what happened here?
What happened to the ship's crew?
This would be more fun if there was someone else here.
That's an ominous sound from around this corner.
Help!
Where did so many of these things come from?
What's that glowing in the distance?
What I would give for even a kitten for company.
I guess these winding corridors have a purpose.
